//java Variables and Datatype Assignments

 Q1.What is statically typed and Dynamically typed programming Language?
Statically typed: Programming languages are referred to as "Static typed" if the
memory of the variable is provided at the time of compilation.
For instance, C, C++, and Java

Dynamically typed: Programming languages are said to as "dynamically typed"
if the memory for the variable is provided at the time of execution.
Like Python, PHP, and JavaScript

Q2.What is variable in Java?
Ans->
A variable is the name of a memory-allocated reserved area. It may be thought of as
the name of a memory location, in other words.

* While the Java programme is running, the value is held in a container.

* To identify the storage location, each variable needs to have a special name.

* A data type is assigned to a variable (we will learn about it after this topic).

Q3. How to assign a value to a variable?
Ans->
Variable names should not begin with a number.For example
int 2 var; // 2 var is an invalid variable.

White Spaces are not permitted in variable names. For example,
int cricket score; // invalid variables.
There is a gap/whitespace between cricket and score.

A java keyword (reserved word) cannot be used as a variable name. For
example, int float; is an invalid expression as float is a predefined
keyword(we will learn about them) in java.

Q4. What are primitive DataType in java?
Ans->
* Following are the primitive datatype in java
 *Boolean data type
 *byte data type
 *int data type
 *long data type
 *float data type
 *double data type
 *char data type
 *short data type

Q5. What are Identifiers in java?
Ans->
An identifier is a name given to a package, class, interface, method, or variable. All identifiers
must have different names.

Q6. List the operators in java?
Ans-> Operators can be identified in java
Operators in Java can be classified into 6 types:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Unary Operators
6. Bitwise Operators

Q7. Explain about increment and decrement operator in java?
Ans->
these are techniques which we use at the time of increment and decrement operator
Increment and decrement operators are unary operators. We can only apply these operators on a single operand, hence these operators are called as unary operators.

we can apply these unary operators on all primitive types except Boolean.
